# Health-Monitoring-Of-Pump-Using-Predictive-Analytics
## Overview
 • The project focuses on predicting a pump’s failure based on the data from the pump.
 • Scraped real-time data of temperature of bearing and vibration of the motor’s casing will be obtained from several
 sensors and signal conditioning modules.
 • From the obtained data, models would be trained to predict the failures based on chosen algorithms.

## Deep Learning models
- LSTM
- Transformers
